# OSSSG website workshop

This repository contains a few example websites for my workshop on [creating a website with open source software](https://michaelmccarthy.tidytales.ca/talk/2022-03-04_creating-websites/). There are three example websites available to view:

- [Simple postcards site](https://osssg-website-workshop.netlify.app/)
- [Customized postcards site](https://deploy-preview-1--osssg-website-workshop.netlify.app/)
- [Customized distill site](https://deploy-preview-2--osssg-website-workshop.netlify.app/)

The latter two websites also demonstrate Netlify's Deploy Preview feature for Pull Requests on GitHub. This feature is incredibly useful for drafting new posts and previewing them online before putting them into production.
