This post is an R Markdown document, so you can use it to write prose and execute code from a variety of languages (e.g., R, python, etc.). Use it for plain writing, coding tutorials, a photo gallery, or anything else you can imagine!

Once you're finished the post, knit it, then it will be included in your site when you build it next.
